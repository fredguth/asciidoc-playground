= Asciidoctor LaTeX Playground

The Asciidoctor LaTeX converter does not support custom templates by default.
Therefore, we have to add some patches to make it work.

First, install the dependencies:

 $ bundle --path=.bundle/gems

Verify that you can run the `asciidoctor-latex` command.

 $ bundle exec asciidoctor-latex -v

To apply the patches that enable the use of custom templates with `asciidoctor-latex`, use the following command:

 $ bundle exec asciidoctor-latex -r ./patches -T templates sample.adoc

You should see that the templates are used in place of the matching handler method in Asciidoctor LaTeX.
